# William's (my) Portfolio Site

I wanted to do something a little quirky for this site, so I decided make my porfolio page into my resume, but all done in the brutalist style.

##### I do not know why, but I LOVE tailwind's brutalist style.

IDK why, but it looks SO GOOD. 

Anyway, enough with the juvenile stuff, this project will just showcase my resume in brutalist format (maybe one day I will update it)
