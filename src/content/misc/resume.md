# Education

<!--The idea with this file is to create a resume which is entirely markdown based using normal text, headers for sections and more. This will automatically be rendered into a PDF using a Google Chrome GitHub actions automation-->

<!--Remove the bullet points and figure out a consistent table structure which can represent an experience / education section-->
